# The Archimedean Spiral

The Archimedean spiral is notable for rotating around a single point at a constant speed and velocity. This creates an aesthetically pleasing and consistent spiral, often used in architecture.

<br />
Its polar coordinates are defined by the following equation:

  ``` r = a + bθ ```

| r        | The radial coordinate, representing the distance from the point of origin                                                |
| θ        | The angular coordinate, the angle relative to the reference direction (horizontally to the right of the point of origin) |
| a        | The offset, how far from the point of origin the spiral should begin                                                     |
| b        | The distance between the loops of the spiral                                                                             |
